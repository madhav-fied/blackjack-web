# Few things that was poor:

1. The Hand component should be rendering unique cards initially

# TODO:

1. Dealer? Can be one card only and then draw card [ WIP ]
1. Evaluate cards for win

1. Money for betting
1. Improve directory structure

1. Player component -> For splitting functionality [ done ]
1. Fix checking logic: use split instead of charAt(0) [ done ]
