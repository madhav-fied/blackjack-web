# Few things that was poor:

1. The Hand component should be rendering unique cards initially

# TODO:

1. Evaluate cards for win - lift state up: context + reducer?

1. Money for betting
1. separate types folder
1. Improve directory structure

1. Dealer? Can be one card only and then draw card [ done ]
1. Player component -> For splitting functionality [ done ]
1. Fix checking logic: use split instead of charAt(0) [ done ]
